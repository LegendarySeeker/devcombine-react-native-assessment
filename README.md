3. Architecture Overview

   Frontend: The app is developed using React Native with Expo for easy cross-platform deployment. It incorporates navigation for seamless user experience.

   Backend: The Golang server handles JWT authentication, location data storage, and exposes endpoints for fetching data. Locations are fetched from the /locations endpoint.

   Google Maps Integration: Google Maps API is used to display the markers on the map. Markers are generated based on the location data retrieved from the server

4. Implementation Decisions

   JWT Authentication: Chose JWT for token-based authentication to secure the application and manage user sessions efficiently.

   Google Maps API: Integrated Google Maps for dynamic location visualization. The map is configured to center around ‚Äú925 Bush St. San Francisco, CA 94109‚Äù to maintain consistency.

   Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling to manage API request failures, token expiration, and provide user-friendly messages.

   Performance Optimization: Designed the application to handle multiple markers efficiently, ensuring smooth performance even when multiple locations are displayed.

5. Future Improvements

   User Profile Management: Implement features to allow users to manage their profiles and preferences.

   Real-time Data Sync: Integrate WebSockets or a similar technology for real-time updates of location data.

   Custom Marker Icons: Consider adding options for custom marker icons and clustering for enhanced visualization when dealing with numerous entries.

   Offline Support: Evaluate the possibility of adding offline functionality so users can access some features without an internet connection.

6. Testing Strategy

   Unit Testing: Use Jest for unit tests, focusing on validating individual components and functions.

   Integration Testing: Apply React Native Testing Library for integration tests to ensure components interact correctly.

   Running Tests: To execute the test suite, go to your project directory and run:
